# Flash the HighAsCG live ISO to USB with persistence

The first-boot NVIDIA picker only works if changes persist across reboots.
For a live-USB-only deployment (no install to internal disk) that means
adding a `persistence` partition to the USB after flashing the ISO.

This is the standard Debian Live persistence layout, which penguins-eggs
inherits. The live boot menu has a "with persistence" entry; pick that one.

## Prerequisites

- The ISO at `/home/eggs/highascg-live*.iso` (built by `eggs produce`).
- A USB stick big enough for: ISO size + ≥ 4 GB persistence overlay
  + your driver-install delta (usually < 1 GB).
- The USB device path. Identify with:
  ```bash
  lsblk -dpno NAME,SIZE,MODEL,TRAN | grep usb
  ```
  In this guide we'll use `/dev/sdX` — **replace with your real device,
  and double-check before any `dd`**.

## Step 1 — Flash the ISO

```bash
ISO=/home/eggs/highascg-live*.iso
sudo umount /dev/sdX?* 2>/dev/null || true
sudo dd if=$ISO of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress oflag=sync conv=fsync
sudo sync
sudo partprobe /dev/sdX
lsblk /dev/sdX
```

After flashing, the USB has 1–2 read-only partitions used by the live image.
The remaining free space at the end of the device is where we'll add the
persistence partition.

## Step 2 — Add a `persistence` partition

```bash
# Find the end of the last existing partition
sudo parted /dev/sdX unit MiB print free

# Create a new partition spanning the remaining free space.
# Replace START_MIB with the start offset shown in the "Free Space" row.
sudo parted -s /dev/sdX -- mkpart primary ext4 START_MIB 100%

# Format and label it. The label MUST be exactly `persistence`.
sudo mkfs.ext4 -L persistence /dev/sdX3   # or sdX4 if there are 3 existing partitions
```

## Step 3 — Write the persistence config

The kernel looks for `/persistence.conf` at the root of the labelled
partition. `/ union` means "make every path in the live root writable via
an overlay backed by this partition".

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/persist
sudo mount /dev/disk/by-label/persistence /mnt/persist
echo '/ union' | sudo tee /mnt/persist/persistence.conf
sudo umount /mnt/persist
```

## Step 4 — Boot and pick the persistence entry

Insert the USB into a target machine, boot from it, and at the GRUB menu
choose **"Live with persistence"** (or the equivalent entry; eggs labels it
explicitly). Subsequent boots remember everything — including the NVIDIA
driver installed by the first-boot picker.

## Verifying the picker on a target machine

After the first boot completes (which may include one automatic reboot):

```bash
cat /var/log/highascg-pick-nvidia.log
ls -la /var/lib/highascg/nvidia-installed
nvidia-smi
systemctl status highascg
```

Expected sequence:

1. Boot from USB → systemd reaches `multi-user.target`.
2. `highascg-pick-nvidia.service` runs:
   - If the recommended branch already matches the loaded one → marker stamped, no reboot, `highascg.service` starts immediately.
   - Otherwise → swap drivers, reboot.
3. (If a reboot happened) Second boot: marker exists, picker is a no-op, `highascg.service` starts.

## Common gotchas

- **No "with persistence" entry in the boot menu.** Some eggs builds hide
  it; press `e` at the default entry and append `persistence` to the
  kernel cmdline, then `Ctrl-X` to boot. To make it permanent, edit the
  ISO's grub config before flashing or pass it via the eggs theme.
- **Picker loops forever.** Marker isn't persisting — you booted without
  `persistence`, or the partition isn't labelled exactly `persistence`,
  or the file isn't named exactly `persistence.conf`.
- **`apt-get install` in the picker fails with "no candidate".** Offline
  cache is missing the dependency tree. Re-run `fetch-debs.sh` with all
  the branches you need; verify with `ls /opt/nvidia-debs | wc -l`.
- **Driver installs but `nvidia-smi` errors after reboot.** DKMS hasn't
  finished building against the live kernel. Wait 30s and retry, or
  `sudo dkms autoinstall && sudo modprobe nvidia`.
